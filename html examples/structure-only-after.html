<!-- Demonstration of syntax-->
<!-- Elements are defined by an opening and closing tag (some elements can be described by only an opening tag though, s/a <br> (line break) or <hr> (horizontal rule)),
    elements can't overlap, so must insert a closing tag before writing a new opening tag, therefore elements can be included within OR alongside other tags,
    in this document, attributes are written in opening tags to add styling to elements, attributes can not be declared in closing tags,
    BASIC SYNTAX: no space between '<' and tag type name, all other spaces don't mean anything, quotation marks are not required around attribute elements but is good practice-->
