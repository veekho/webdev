<!-- Historically, elemnts were either block-level or inline, but HTML5 specification split these 2 types into 7, though 2 is still relevant and easier to think about-->
<!-- HTML files are read in and rendered line by line,
    block-level render on a NEW line, and can include EITHER block-level OR inline elements,
    inline elements render on the EXISTING line, and can ONLY include inline elements-->
